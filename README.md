Introduction


The pandastable library provides a table widget for Tkinter with plotting and data manipulation functionality. It uses the pandas DataFrame class to store table data. Pandas is an open source Python library providing high-performance data structures and data analysis tools. Tkinter is the standard GUI toolkit for python. It is intended for the following uses:

for python/tkinter GUI developers who want to include a table in their application that can store and process large amounts of data
for non-programmers who are not familiar with Python or the pandas API and want to use the included DataExplore application to manipulate/view their data
it may also be useful for data analysts and programmers who want to get an initial interactive look at their tabular data without coding
